# SparkExercises
Here you can find some exercises I have resolved to practice my Spark skills, including using spark.sql, Scala and PySpark
I have worked with two main databases:
Nasa: webserver logs from nasa webpage.
Padron: data from the city of Madrid census.
Scala exercises are coded using maven.
Python, Scala and Spark versions can be found in pom.xml
