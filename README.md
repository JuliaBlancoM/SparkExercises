# SparkExercises
Here you can find some exercises I have resolved to practice my Spark skills, including using spark.sql, Scala and PySpark
Scala exercises are coded using NASA web server logs and they can be found in the folder "nasa"
Python and SQL exercises are coded using Madrid census data and they are found in the folder "madridcensus"
